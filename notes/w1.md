### Reduction

functional programs dont have statements, their execution model is reduction

* reduction - converting reducible expressions (**redex**) to simpler forms

the result does not depend on the reduction path - Church-Rosser theorem - https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Church%E2%80%93Rosser_theorem

### first issues

ghci seems to require a special notation for function definition with `let`. Following the tutorial blindly does not do it: 

`lucky :: (Integral a) => a -> String` results in `<interactive>:1:1: Not in scope: 'lucky'`

`lucky x = show (x + 1)` cannot be parsed: `<interactive>:2:9: parse error on input ‘=’`

using `let` works just fine: `let lucky x = show (x + 1)`

### runnning a haskell file

* compiling it first: 

`ghc -o myrunnable myscript.hs`
`./myrunnable`

* interpreting it: 

`runhaskell myscript.hs`
`runghc myscript.hs`

* executable haskell file:

```
#!/usr/bin/env runhaskell
main = putStrLn "hello world"
```

dont forget to `chmod +x myscript.hs`
