### haskell IDE

yes yes, a real badass hacker only needs his trusty vim, but I dont care.

* Leksah: http://leksah.org/

https://github.com/leksah/leksah



* IJ plugin

	* official plugin - a bit old - more than a year wihtout updates
	* haskforce - looks good - http://haskforce.com/

hmm, dont get no autocomplete, cant run the files...I dont know how this is supposed to work

* Atom plugins

https://atom.io/packages/ide-haskell-repl
http://www.jkrause.io/blog/2016/03/26/setup-atom-io-for-developing-haskell-on-osx/
https://atom.io/packages/ide-haskell
http://amixtureofmusings.com/2016/01/23/getting-started-with-haskell/
http://achernyak.me/universal-haskell-dev-enviornment

did not manage to get them running. followed all advice on dependencies and setup/config.

atom does absolutely nothing when an .hs file is opened. No errors on the dev console, nothing. No additional panes or Haskell IDE menu entry...disappointed
